 # Node.js Express EJS Example

This project demonstrates how to use Node.js, Express, and EJS to create a simple web application.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

* Node.js (version 16 or later)
* npm (version 7 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the project, run the following command in the terminal window:

```
npm start
```

This will start the Node.js server on port 3000.

## Code Overview

The project consists of the following files:

* `index.js`: This is the main entry point of the application. It sets up the Express application and defines the routes.
* `models/index.js`: This file defines the database models.
* `views/homePage.ejs`: This is the EJS template for the home page.
* `views/about.ejs`: This is the EJS template for the about page.

### index.js

The `index.js` file is the main entry point of the application. It sets up the Express application and defines the routes.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Set the view engine to EJS
app.set("view engine", "ejs");

// Define the routes
app.get("/", getHomePage);
app.get("/about", getAboutPage);

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is listening on port 3000");
});
```

### models/index.js

The `models/index.js` file defines the database models. In this example, we have a single model called `User`.

```javascript
const Sequelize = require("sequelize");
const sequelize = new Sequelize("database", "username", "password", {
  host: "localhost",
  dialect: "mysql",
});

const User = sequelize.define("User", {
  id: {
    type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
    primaryKey: true,
    autoIncrement: true,
  },
  name: {
