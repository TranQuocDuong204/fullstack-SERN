 ### Database Configuration File

This file contains the database configuration for a Rails application. It specifies the credentials and connection details for the development, test, and production environments.

#### File Structure

The file is structured as a JSON object with three keys: `development`, `test`, and `production`. Each key represents a different environment and contains the following properties:

- `username`: The username to connect to the database.
- `password`: The password to connect to the database.
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to.
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the database server.
- `dialect`: The database dialect, which specifies the type of database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

#### Example

Here is an example of a completed database configuration file:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_development",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "test": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_test",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "production": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_production",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
```

#### Usage

To use this configuration file, you need to specify the environment you want to connect to in your Rails application. This can be done by setting the `RAILS_ENV` environment variable. For example, to connect to the development environment, you would set `RAILS_ENV=development`.

Once the environment is set, Rails will automatically load the appropriate database configuration from this file and establish a connection to the database.

#### Additional Notes

- The `password` property can be left blank if you are using a database that does not require a password.
- The `host` property can be left blank if the database is running on the same machine as your Rails application.
- The `dialect` property can be left blank if you are using the default database dialect for your
